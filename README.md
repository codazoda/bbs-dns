# DNServer

DNServer is a minimalist DNS server written in PHP. To start the server simply download the files and run the following command.

```
sudo php bbsdns.php
```

DNServer was written by Cesar Rodas and released into the public domain. This version was published to GitHub to server the Wireless BBS IP of 192.168.1.227 in response to every request on a local wifi router. Explained in my [Wireless BBS blog post](https://www.joeldare.com/blog/post/wireless-bbs/).
